Display is awesome and bigger , the bezel is much slimmer , dedicated camera control feature  with swipe feature  and changes of exposure is superb and quick. Lighter weight even. Overall an excellent one . Definitely can  go for it 🫶👍🤍 READ MORE Dhruba jyoti Barman Certified Buyer , Numaligarh Refinery Township 11 months ago 2229 890 Permalink Report Abuse || 5 Great product Loved it best in the market .
